# HighlightsBot
Football Highlights Telegram bot.

Hey everyone,
I'm happy to share my first telegram bot project, GerryTheBot.
Gerry (named after my dog) allows you to watch and catch up with the latest football highlights from around the world.
This project was an opportunity for me to gain some experience with Python and its open-source libraries, such as python-telegram-bot and scorebat for the highlights retrieval.
One of the main challenges I faced was implementing a menu logic for the "Other" leagues in order to prevent the overloading of options. I've managed to solve that by grouping the data and manipulating it to make it more comfortable for the user.
The bot is deployed using Heroku, and I'll be more than happy to get your feedback about it.
